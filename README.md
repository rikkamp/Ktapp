# Ktapp

## info
This repo is for a app. This app is for a transport company that at the moment manually writes dow all its data and later inserts
it in a excel sheet and later converts it to pdf. With this app he can add his data in a simple crud that is able to send a mail to his email adress
and send a PDF with it with the data of that week.

## methods
In this project I use laravel combined with react front-end. I choose this because you can easely handle the backend with laravel and there are a lot of libs that can be used. Also Laravel has a mailing system. The database will be a phpmyadmin database. This is because the live enviorement only supports that. The pdf will be made with Barry vdh DOMPDF this because it is a really easy library. The frontend will be done with react because it can easely handle data from the backend.
